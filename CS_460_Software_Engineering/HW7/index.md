## About Homework 7

In homework 7, the goal was to learn ajax by connecting the Giphy API. The original assignment can be found [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW7.html) and the code itself can be found [here](https://github.com/mcalawa/senior_project/tree/master/CS_460_Software_Engineering/HW7).

## A Video Demo

A demo video that shows the completed homework in action. A trigger warning for some body horror, I guess, since one of the things I searched was the excellent philosophical anime series Mushishi and some of the results may have involved animated eyes falling out of heads.
