           <h2>I'm a Geek About All Kinds of Things</h2>
           <p>In case you didn't know, my first love—and my first major—was English. I love to read and write. I love words. I'm one of those weird people that has not only favorite books, but favorite openings and favorite words. So, just like the other pages on this site, here are a few more things I love.</p>
           
           <h2>Great Opening Lines</h2>
           <dl>
               <dt><em>Invitation to a Beheading</em> by Vladimir Nabokov</dt>
               <dd>In accordance with the law the death sentence was announced to Cincinnatus C. in a whisper.</dd>
               <dt><em>The Great Gatsby</em> by F. Scott Fitzgerald</dt>
               <dd>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father game me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.</dd>
               <dt><em>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</em> by C.S. Lewis</dt>
               <dd>There was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it.</dd>
               <dt><em>The Third Policeman</em> by Flann O'Brien</dt>
               <dd>"Not everybody knows how I killed old Phillip Mathers, smashing his jaw in with my spade; but first it is better to speak of my friendship with John Divney because it was he who first knocked old Mathers down by giving him a great blow in the neck with a special bicycle-pump which he manufactured himself out of a hollow iron bar."</dd>
               <dt><em>The Defense</em> by Vladimir Nabokov</dt>
               <dd>What struck him most wasthe fact that from Monday on he would be Luzhin.</dd>
           </dl>
       </div>
       <div class="col2">
           <h2>My Favorite Word</h2>
           <dl>
               <dt>Lethologica (noun)</dt>
               <dd>the inability to remember a word or put your finger on the right word</dd>
           </dl>
           
           <h2>Great Last Lines (Beware of Spoilers)</h2>
           <dl>
               <dt><em>The Defense</em> by Vladimir Nabokov</dt>
               <dd>The door was burst in. "Aleksandr Ivonovich, Aleksandr Ivanovich," roared several voices.<br/><span class="tab"></span>But there was no Aleksandr Ivanovich.</dd>
               <dt>"The Yellow Wallpaper" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman</dt>
               <dd>"I've got out at last," said I, "in spite of you and Jane. And I've pulled off most of the paper, so you can't put me back!"<br/>
               <span class="tab"></span>Now why should that man have fainted? But he did, and right across my path by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!</dd>
               <dt><em>Lolita</em> by Vladimir Nabokov</dt>
               <dd>I am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. And this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita.</dd>
               <dt><em>The Great Gatsby</em> by Vladimir Nabokov</dt>
               <dd>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</dd>
           </dl>
           
           <p>A special mention goes to Vladimir Nabokov's Invitation to a Beheading, which has the best final two chapters of anything I have ever read.</p>
