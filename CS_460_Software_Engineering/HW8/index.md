## About Homework 8 and 9

Homework 8 involved combining everything we had learned so far to create a site with a multi-table, relational database of our own design that included CRUD functionality. The assignment page for homework 8 can be found [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW8.html). Homework 9 involved deploying the completed homework 8 to the cloud with Azure. The assignment page for homework 9 can be found [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW9.html). The code for both parts can be found on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/mcalawa/senior_project/tree/master/CS_460_Software_Engineering/HW8).
